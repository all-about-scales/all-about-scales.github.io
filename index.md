### What is 'scale'?
The size of a model or miniature relative to whatever it is a representation of is known as its _scale_. Scales can be defined in a variety of confusing ways, for a variety of historical reasons. For example, models of historical vehicles are often defined simply as "1/48", implying that the model is a forty-eighth the size of the original. Wargaming figures instead regularly use the 'eye height' measure, where a '28mm' model is a model scaled such that a human would be 28mm tall up to their eyes (presumably to avoid the difficulty of accounting for fancy hats). Model railway scales are more complicated still.

This page serves as a reference to allow you to easily convert between 'equivalent' scale representations, and to record common uses of those scales.

Large amounts of the information contained herewithin is taken from http://theminiaturespage.com/ref/scales.html upon which this serves to update and elaborate. That page has been an invaluable resource to me over the years and I highly recommend you check it out for more details about scale conversion.

> Note: Many conversions shown here are slightly rounded, particularly if the equivalent is close to a commonly-used term for a scale.
>
> For instance, I have merged 1/100 and 15mm scales (which are more strictly 16.1mm and 1/107 respectively), because they are so close as to be indistinguishable.

| 1/X scale  | Xmm eye height | X to the foot | Model Railway | Uses
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ---
| Tiny       |                |               |               | (to be expanded)
| **1/2400** | 0.67mm         | | | Modern naval miniatures including WWI, WWII, and beyond.
| **1/1250** | 1.29mm         | | | Naval miniatures for the most part. Used by actual militaries for training.
| **1/1200** | 1.34mm         | 1 inch to 100 feet          | | UK/USA alternative to 1/1250.
| 1/800      | **2mm**        | | | Probably the smallest scale where you field units of actual people, although at this scale, units are generally textured blobs, a whole formation to a base.
| 1/450      | 3.58mm         |               | **T scale**   | The tiniest working model railways. Sometimes referred to as 1/480 instead.
| **1/270**  | **6mm**        | | | At this scale you start to actually get individual figures for people (rather than just bumps), although they may still be moulded together onto a strip. Also used for sci-fi vehicles such as FFG's _X-wing Miniatures Game_, Games Workshop's new Adeptus Titanicus. Old Epic 40k was roughly 6mm too.
| **1/220**  | 7mm            |               | **Z scale**   |
| 1/160      | **10mm**       |               | **N scale**   | Comparatively large number of models available from different genres, including Games Workshop's old Warmaster.
| **1/144**  | 12mm           | | | Popular scale modelling scale. Gundam's High-Grade (HG) and Real-Grade (RG) models are normally made to this scale.
| **1/100**  | **15mm**       | | | Popular scale for all sorts of wargaming, with both individual infantry figures and a wide variety of vehicles availables. Flames of War models are at this scale, as are Gundam's Master-Grade (MG) models.
| 1/87       | 18.5mm         |               | **HO scale**  | Also used for diecast civilian cars.
| 1/80       | **20mm**       | | | Some wargaming figures are available as this scale.
| 1/76       | 21.2mm         |               | **OO scale**  | British alternative to HO, diecast cars also available.
| **1/72**   | 22.4mm         | 1 inch to 6 feet |            | Primarily used for scale models of vehicles and planes
| 1/64       | **25mm**       |               | **S scale**   | Original scale of early Games Workshop (/Ral Partha) models.
| **1/56**   | **28mm**       | | | Most popular wargaming scale, used for Warlord's Bolt Action, Napoleonics (including Perry Miniatures variety of plastic kits), and, Games Workshop's mainline games (although they increasingly creep upwards). Although closer to 1/58, vehicles at this scale are increasingly being sold as 1/56.
| **1/48**   | **32mm**       |               | **O scale** (USA) | Relatively common scale for a variety of purposes, both in scale modelling and wargaming. Star Wars Legion uses this scale.
| 1/43.5     | 37mm           | 7mm to the foot | **O scale** (UK) | Die-cast cars available.
